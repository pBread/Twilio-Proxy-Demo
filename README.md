The code relevant to Proxy functionality can be found in these files: [functions/get-reserved-number.ts](https://github.com/pBread/Twilio-Proxy-Demo/blob/main/functions/get-reserved-number.ts) & [functions/out-of-session-callback.ts](https://github.com/pBread/Twilio-Proxy-Demo/blob/main/functions/out-of-session-callback.ts). These were deployed as [serverless functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions) on Twilio.

The remainder of this repository is the demo presentation and largely not relevant for Proxy.
